# Project Brief: `Find a place with love for - Ourpet`

#### Ourpet is 
1. Website for people who loves pet
2. Website for dog owner who is busy or travels a lot
3. Website which can connect dog owner and dog sitter

### Product Goal
* We will help pet owner to find cozy and comfortable place for dogs.

### Motivation
#### I want to help to find the most comfortable place for pet
I like share economy model of Airbnb or Uber that connects people to share economy because it makes business possible with existing resources. So I wanted to build business based on share economy model.

Also as a dog owner and an expat living abroad who loves travelling, often I found it's very difficult to find a place for my pet to take a rest as she does at home. I believe many dog owners don’t want their pet to be locked in the cage or feel abandoned while they are gone.

I came up with this idea - Airbnb for dog - which is easy to use and can find dog friendly home with heartful sitter who will take care of our pet with love. It’s very helpful app for traveler seeking for affordable but comfortable accommodation for their beloved pet!

### User Understanding - What are their pain points?
*	Hard to find the trustable dog sitting places and it’s very limited in HCM city.
*	Even if they find the dog sitting place, most of time the dogs need to be locked in the cage and it would be very difficult to be taken cared one by one.

### User Understanding - Who are they? (Demographic)
#### Busy young professionals – with mostly age group in 25-35
*	My target demographic is expats living in Ho Chi Minh City, who is travelling abroad often, who is looking for the most comfortable place for their dog and willing to pay more for that.
*	My target demographic is always opened for the new experience and  willing to explore new service.
